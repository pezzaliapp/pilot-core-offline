# pilot-core-offline

**Offline-first rule-based text engine**

Experimental core for “simplified AI”:
text analysis, extraction, summarization and rewriting
using heuristics, rules and templates — **no cloud, no APIs**.

---

## Why
Most “AI apps” depend on servers and prompts.
This project explores a different path:
**useful intelligence that runs entirely in the browser.**

- No accounts
- No data sent anywhere
- Works offline
- Instant response

---

## What it does
- Short summaries
- Key points extraction
- To-Do detection
- Text cleanup
- Reply templates
- Minimal captions

All rule-based.

---

## Tech
- Plain HTML / CSS / JS
- Service Worker for offline usage
- Zero dependencies

---

## Status
Experimental V1  
Designed as a **core engine**, reusable in other projects
(e.g. ReleasePilot, PezzaliAPP tools).
